                Metal Gear Solid was revolutionary for its time. A tactical
                espionage game with an ambitious and bizarre story with many
                unexpected twists and turns.
              </li>
              <li>
                Epic boss battles, each unique with captivating mechanics. Each
                boss has a big personality and engaging backstory. Psycho-Mantis
                being the highlight - a telekenetic mind-reader who would gague
                your personality on how often you saved and predict your every
                move.
              </li>
              <li>
                The soundtrack was amazing and truly iconic, changing with each
                environment and evoking a rollercoaster of emotions.

                A truly epic and deep role-playing game where your choices
                really matter.
              </li>

              <li>
                This is a game where you can truly lose yourself for weeks on
                end. The world is massive and beautiful with lots of attention
                to detail. Turn-based combat is a wonderful addition and you
                have the option to switch between real-time with pause and
                turn-based on the fly.
              </li>
              <li>
                Your companions are well-fleshed out with engaging backstories
                that make you either love them or hate them. The crusade system
                is a step-up from the kingdom management system in the previous
                game, though this is not for everyone and thankfully you can let
                the game handle the crusade for you.

              <li>
                Clever, complex combat that allows you to use your environment

              </li>
              <li>
                You can steal your way to riches, robbing merchants blind while
                one of your other characters distracts them. Interactivity like
                no other game - if you can imagine it, the game probably allows
                you to do it!
